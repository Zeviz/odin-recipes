    <p>Chocolate chip Muffins</p>
    <p>I love enjoying a good muffin with a nice, warm cup of coffee, especially now that the fall weather is setting in.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 & ½ cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (13g) baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5g) baking soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp (2.5g) salt</li>
        <li>½ cup (114g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) buttermilk (see notes for substitutions*)</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray a 12 cup muffin tray with non-stick cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, milk and vanilla. Slowly add to the dry ingredients. Gently fold together until JUST combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter into the 12 muffin cups and bake at 425°F for 5 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue to bake for another 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not overbake or the muffins will be dry. Let cool for about 5-10 minutes and enjoy warm.</li>
